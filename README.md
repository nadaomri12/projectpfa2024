- ## CI/CD
whenever a developer wants to add a new feature or modify the code, they simply need to make a push, and all changes will automatically reflect remotely.
In the next video, the demonstration will begin by showcasing the current state of the navbar. Subsequently, we'll make the desired changes in the code, followed by observing the automatic update and the resulting change in the navbar.
